# loop examples
# The range() function generates a sequence of numbers from the start value to the end value.
for number in range(1, 6):
    print(f"number: {number}")  # Output: 1 2 3 4 5

# The range() function can also take a step argument to generate numbers with a specific step value.
for number in range(1, 10, 2):
    print(f"number: {number}")  # Output: 1 3 5 7 9

# The range() function can also generate numbers in descending order.
for number in range(5, 0, -1):
    print(f"number: {number}")  # Output: 5 4 3 2 1

# The for loop can also iterate over a list of items.

    print(f"fruit: {fruit}")  # Output: apple banana cherry

# The for loop can also iterate over a tuple of items.

# The for loop can also iterate over a string.

    print(f"letter: {letter}")  # Output: A h m e t

# The for loop can also iterate over a dictionary.
person = {"name": "Ahmet", "age": 21, "city": "Istanbul"}

### Example 1: Flattening a List of Lists
# Suppose you have a list of lists of numbers and you want to flatten it into a single list of numbers.
nested_list = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
flattened_list = [num for sublist in nested_list for num in sublist]
print(flattened_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
import numpy as np

np.flatten = nested_list
print(np.flatten)

nested2_list = [[1,2,3,4],[5,6,7,8],[9,10,11,12],[13,14,15,16]]
flattened2_list = [i for sublist in nested2_list for i in sublist if i >5 and not i % 2 ==0]
print(flattened2_list)

### Example 2: Filtering and Flattening a List of Lists
# Suppose you have a list of lists of numbers and you want to flatten it into a single list of even numbers.
nested_list = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
even_numbers = [num for sublist in nested_list for num in sublist if num % 2 == 0]
print(even_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8]


### Example 3: Extracting Specific Elements from a List of Dictionaries
# Suppose you have a list of dictionaries representing students and their grades, 
# and you want to extract the names of students who scored above 80.
students = [
    {"name": "Alice", "grade": 85},
    {"name": "Bob", "grade": 75},
    {"name": "Charlie", "grade": 90}
]
high_scorers = [student["name"] for student in students if student["grade"] > 80]
print(high_scorers)  # Output: ['Alice', 'Charlie']


### Example 4: Combining Two Lists with a Condition
# Suppose you have two lists of numbers and 
# you want to create a list of tuples containing pairs of numbers where the sum is even.
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = [4, 5, 6]
even_sum_pairs = [(x, y) for x in list1 for y in list2 if (x + y) % 2 == 0]
print(even_sum_pairs)  # Output: [(1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 5)]


### Example 5: Creating a List of Tuples from a Dictionary
# Suppose you have a dictionary of items and their prices and 
# you want to create a list of tuples containing the items and their prices where the price is above 10.
items = {
    "apple": 5,
    "banana": 12,
    "cherry": 15,
    "date": 8
}
expensive_items = [(item, price) for item, price in items.items() if price > 10]
print(expensive_items)  # Output: [('banana', 12), ('cherry', 15)]


"""
Comprehensions and generators are related concepts in Python, but they serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics. Here's a clear comparison:

### Comprehensions

1. **Definition**:
   - Comprehensions are a concise way to create collections such as lists, sets, and dictionaries.

2. **Types**:
   - **List Comprehensions**: Create lists.
   - **Set Comprehensions**: Create sets.
   - **Dictionary Comprehensions**: Create dictionaries.

3. **Syntax**:
   - List Comprehension: `[expression for item in iterable if condition]`
   - Set Comprehension: `{expression for item in iterable if condition}`
   - Dictionary Comprehension: `{key: value for item in iterable if condition}`

4. **Example**:
   - List Comprehension: `[x**2 for x in range(10)]` creates a list of squares.

### Generators

1. **Definition**:
   - Generators are a way to create iterators that generate values on-the-fly and do not store the entire sequence in memory.

2. **Types**:
   - **Generator Functions**: Use the `yield` keyword to produce values one at a time.
   - **Generator Expressions**: Similar to comprehensions but use parentheses and generate values lazily.

3. **Syntax**:
   - Generator Expression: `(expression for item in iterable if condition)`

4. **Example**:
   - Generator Expression: `(x**2 for x in range(10))` creates a generator that yields squares.

### Key Differences

1. **Memory Usage**:
   - Comprehensions create collections that are stored in memory.
   - Generators produce values one at a time and do not store the entire sequence in memory.

2. **Evaluation**:
   - Comprehensions evaluate and store all elements immediately.
   - Generators evaluate elements lazily, generating them as needed.

### Summary

- **Comprehensions**: A concise way to create collections like lists, sets, and dictionaries.
- **Generators**: A way to create iterators that generate values on-the-fly, using less memory.

Both comprehensions and generators are powerful tools in Python, each with its own use cases and advantages.
